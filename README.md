# Color of Coronavirus: A Natural Language Processing Approach to Examining Coronavirus Research in African/African American populations

#### Project Status: Complete

## Motivation 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19). The available COVID-19 statistics on race show that minorities have disproportionately contracted and died from coronavirus, making up a larger share of infections than they do of the general population. 

## Project Goals
* Apply NLP to CORD-19 dataset publications to examine differences in coronvirus-related research done on African/African African American populations than other races/ethnic groups
* Develop a search tool that provides summarizations of African/African American coronvirus-related publications related to the search terms

## Methods & Technology
* **Language**: Python
* **Data Format**: JSON
* **Data Processing**: Pandas, Numpy, Regular Expression
* **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, Gensim, SpaCy
* **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
* **Topic Modeling**: latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
* **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
* **Interactivitiy**: IPython widgets (ipywidgets)
* **Markup**: HTML
